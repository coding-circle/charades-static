# Static Charades mockups

I decided to flesh out the design system with static HTML/CSS, and ended up troubleshooting a bunch of actual front-end issues. I figure someone can extract this into components directly from here so nothing gets lost in translation ðŸ™ƒ

## Web components

I'm also exploring a possible separate charades front-end built with Web Components and some minimal templating functions.
